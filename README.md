# Atom Framework
An easy to implement Roblox framework.

## Introduction
The Atom Framework is an open-source framework used for crazyattaker1's games on Roblox.
The Atom Framework is easy to work with and encourages modular coding.
Documentation can be found in the documentation/ folder.

## Features
Atom was designed to do all the heavy work for multi module codebases. Some of the features Atom contains to assist you as a developer are:
* Services, Controllers and Components - Seperate server and client code by using specialized containers for each type and a special type for shared code called Components.
* Libraries - Packages from the Atom registry to include extra functionality that you can implement in your own modules.
* Out-of-the-box Networking - A custom developed network solution that doesn't rely on Roblox remotes.
* Automatic error handling - Allow Atom to automatically deal with errors or tell it what to do when an error occurs.
* Automatic Garbage Collection - Atom uses the Janitor module to clean up instances when they're no longer needed.
